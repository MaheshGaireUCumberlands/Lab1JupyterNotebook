# MSCS 634 Lab 1 – Data Analysis and Preparation

## Author
Mahesh Gaire

## Dataset
Sample Superstore

## Lab Purpose
This lab demonstrates:
- Data visualization techniques
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, scaling)
- Statistical analysis (central tendency, dispersion, correlation)

## Key Insights
- Scatter plots revealed a positive correlation between Sales and Profit.
- Line plots showed sales trends over time with seasonal peaks.
- Outlier detection identified extreme profit and discount values.
- Data scaling normalized numerical columns for consistency.
- Correlation analysis confirmed relationships among Sales, Profit, Discount, and Quantity.

## Challenges
- Initial encoding errors in the CSV file (`utf-8` decode issue) resolved using `ISO-8859-1`.
- Minor adjustments needed for missing values and column selection.
